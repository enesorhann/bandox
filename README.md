## üöÄ About Bandox

Bandox is a modular Flutter application designed to streamline task and team management using the Kanban methodology. Beyond its core task management capabilities, Bandox integrates secure, internal messaging tailored for organizations. It combines simplicity and ease of use with robust security features ‚Äî including SMS-based verification and private company-wide communication channels.

This approach ensures that all internal conversations remain confidential and securely stored within the company‚Äôs own infrastructure or database, avoiding reliance on external messaging platforms like email or WhatsApp. By centralizing communication and task tracking in one intuitive interface, Bandox empowers companies to maintain control over their data privacy and operational efficiency, fostering a safer and more transparent workplace environment.
